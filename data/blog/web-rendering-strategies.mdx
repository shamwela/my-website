These are the 4 ways to render your web pages:

1. Static Site Generation (SSG)
2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
3. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
4. Client Side Rendering (CSR).

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

This generates HTML at build time. This generated HTML is reused every time someone visit your web page. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) supports SSG.

### Pros

- Much faster than Server-Side Rendering
- Best for [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)
- Easiest to deploy

### Cons

- Builds are slower
- Need to rebuild every time you make a change

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

This generates HTML every time someone visit your web page. This is good for websites with dynamic data and a lot of different pages. Next.js supports SSR.

### Pros

- Builds are faster
- Good for SEO

### Cons

- Frequent server requests
- Deployment is harder than SSG.
- Slow TTFB (Time to First Byte). Time to First Byte is the time between clicking a link and the first bit of content coming in.
- Full page reloads

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

This is similar to SSG. But instead of rebuilding the site every time, you set `revalidate` time (for example, every 10 seconds). Next.js supports ISR.

### Pros

- Most pros of SSG

### Cons

- Because this revalidates more often than SSG, it may costs more.

## Client Side Rendering (CSR)

First, the browser loads a HTML with little to no content. Then, it fetches the JavaScript and compiles everything. If the user disabled JavaScript, your website won't work. [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) supports CSR.

### Pros

- Good for data heavy pages (for example, dashboards, account pages)
- Fast rendering after the initial load

### Cons

- Initial load is slow because the browser needs to download the JavaScript first
- Bad SEO because search engines can't crawl the web page well

## How to choose

- Use SSG for blog, documentation, marketing page etc.
- Use SSR for newsfeed, chat app, etc.
- Use ISR for blog page with comments, etc.
- Use CSR for account dashboard, etc.
