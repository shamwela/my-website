Every page should have the followings:

```html
<title>Your Page Title</title>
<meta name="description" content="Your description" />
<main>
  <h1>Your Heading 1</h1>
</main>
```

Use `<nav>` for the navigation bar and `<footer>` for the footer. Don't use `<div>`s for these.

Don't skip headings. For example, don't use `<h2>` if you haven't used `<h1>` in that page. You can edit the font sizes with CSS.

Always add `width` and `height` attributes to `<img>`. Unless it is a decorative image, also add the `alt` attribute.

Don't use [deprecated HTML tags and attributes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-the-html-tags-that-deprecated-in-html5).

Use [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org) to check your HTML. It will pick up potential problems such as missing closing tags and using tags that wonâ€™t work properly on all browsers.

Don't use `<table>` for layout. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid instead.

Use `loading=lazy` attribute to defer the loading of `<img>` until the user scrolls to them. For example, `<img src='dog.png' alt='A dog' loading='lazy'>`

Add `type='search'` in `<input>` and you get the **clear** button for free.

Adding `rel='noreferrer'` to your `target='_blank'` links avoids performance and security issues. [Learn more about this on web.dev.](https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener)

Add `<base target='_blank'>` in a page `<head>` to open all links in that page in a new tab.

```html
<head>
  <base target="_blank" />
</head>
```

Download file when clicking on the link instead of navigating to the file: `<a href='dog.png' download>`
