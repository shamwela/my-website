## Introduction

This is my website to share about me, my projects, and blog.

Almost everything is pre-rendered using Static Site Generation. So, this is extremely fast.

## Technologies used

Main framework: Next.js

Main language: TypeScript

Content: MDX and mdx-bundler

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

Others: Plaiceholder, ESLint, Husky, Prettier.

Source code is currently private because I don't want others to copy my work.

## Purpose and goal

I built this website because I want to improve my existing tech stack knowledge and try out new ones.

This started out as a blog and later I showcased my projects. My expected outcome is to get a developer job.

This website design hasn't changed much. I like to keep it simple and dark.

## Spotlight

MDX was the hardest part. MDX is great for content-heavy website like mine. There're many ways to implement MDX with Next.js. I chose `mdx-bundler` because it's simple, feature-rich, and recommended by a lot of people.

If I statically import the images and add `placeholder='blur'`, Next.js will automatically generate a blur image placeholder. But I can't statically import images in my MDX files. So, I use the following approach.

I implemented blur image placeholder using `plaiceholder`. Without blur image placeholder, the user will see a blank area while the image is loading. This is confusing for the user. With blur image placeholder, the user will see a blur image while the image is loading. This tells the user that the image is loading. This also gives an illusion that the image loads faster.

## Current status

I usually share my blogs with my friends. They read them to learn about web development. They say they like my website ðŸ˜….

## Lessons learned

I learned how to use Husky to add pre-commit git hooks. I check formatting using Prettier, linting using ESLint, and check TypeScript errors using the TypeScript compiler.

I also learned about the Open Graph protocol and Twitter Card Tags. These two are important for Search Engine Optimization.

Another thing is preloading font files. Preloading is downloading and caching as soon as possible. In `vercel.json`, I cached my font files for a year.

Next.js is great. I used Static Site Generation to make this website fast. Next.js also provides image optimization, file-based routing, and much more.

I used to make silly type errors with JavaScript. TypeScript helped me with type checking, autocompletion, and confidence with my code.

For accessibility, I used `aria-current='page'` for the active navigation link. I also added `alt` in every image. I tested my website using Screen Reader extension and made sure everything is easy to use. I also tested using only keyboard to navigate and it works fine.
