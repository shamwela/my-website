Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you haven't already. It has many great extensions. It's easy to use, fast and completely free. In my opinion, it's the best code editor.

## Prettier - Code formatter

Prettier will make your code look pretty. Go to the settings and search for _format on save_ and enable it too. Then, Prettier will format your code everytime you save.

## GitHub Copilot

Sign up for [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/signup) if you haven't
already. It will give you suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside
your editor.

## Auto Rename Tag

When you rename one HTML tag, automatically rename the paired HTML tag. This also works with JSX and TSX.

## Code Spell Checker

This helps catch common spelling errors.

## Live Server

This is for vanilla front-end projects. Inside VS Code, open any HTML file and click on _Go Live_ on the bottom status bar.

## Auto Import

Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports. Works with Typescript and TSX.

## ESLint

This is only for JavaScript. It statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems.

There are also language or framework specific extensions. Examples: Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, React Native Tools and MDX.

This blog post will be edited if I find other useful extensions.
