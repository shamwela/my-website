Follow a strict curriculum. Don't learn things randomly.

Don't memorize things.

Code daily.

Sleep 8 hours every night. If you don't rest well, your brain won't work well.

Spend 50% of your time following tutorials and another 50% building your own projects.

Focus on one thing at a time.

Read documentations.

Don't compare your 1 year progress with someone else's 10 years progress.

Certifications are good to have but projects are more important.

Learn how to use Git and GitHub early. And put your projects on GitHub.
