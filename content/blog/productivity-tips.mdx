Don't multitask.

![Elon Musk's schedule](/images/elon-musk-schedule.png)

Prioritize your tasks. Do the most important things first.

Plan almost every hour of your day. This includes both your professional and personal life.

I use social media less than 2 hours a day. I turn off almost every notification. I follow only the accounts that either add value or entertain. Unfollow or block everything else.

I sleep about 8 hours every night which is great for my health.

Delete unnecessary files and organize the remaining ones.

While you're working, you shouldn't be interrupted. Turn off notifications, and use a headphone to block noises.

The followings are my favorite free productivity apps.

- For high priority or repeated tasks, I use [Google Calendar](https://google.com/calendar).
- For other tasks, I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com).
- For notes, I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so).
