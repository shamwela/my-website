This is how I manage my life.

Don't multitask. For example, I usually blog on Monday and Tuesday. I code on other days. This way, there's less stress and more focus.

Prioritize your tasks. Do the most important things first.

Work hard, play hard.

Plan almost every hour of your day. This includes both your professional and personal life.

I use social media less than 2 hours a day. I turn off almost every notification. I follow only the accounts that either add value or entertain. Unfollow or block everything else.

In my opinion, gaming is a waste of time and energy. So, I don't play games.

I sleep about 8 hours every night which is great for my health.

I don't do anything that doesn't improve my life like smoking or drinking alcohol.

Delete unnecessary files and organize the remaining ones.

While you're working, you shouldn't be interrupted. Turn off notifications, and use a headphone to block noises.

The followings are my favorite free productivity apps.

- For high priority or repeated tasks, I use [Google Calendar](https://google.com/calendar).
- For other tasks, I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com).
- For notes, I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so).
