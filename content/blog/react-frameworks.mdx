**This blog assumes you know [React basics](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and [web rendering strategies](/blog/web-rendering-strategies).**

React frameworks are the frameworks that are built on top of React.

## Why not just use React?

React can only do Client-Side Rendering (CSR). You can setup Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and other rendering methods, but it's hard.

### Pros

- Easiest

### Cons

- No SSR and other rendering methods by default
- No code-splitting by default
- Have to use a routing library like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) which is harder than file-based routing

## Next.js

### Pros

- Next.js provides ISR, SSG, SSR, and CSR on a per-page basis. (Next.js provides ISR, and Gatsby provides DSG. They are similar but have minor differences.)
- Can build full-stack app using [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
- [File-based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) (When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.)
- Can optimize images using the Next.js Image Component.

### Cons

- A bit harder than Create React App
- Doesn't have plugins like Gatsby

## Gatsby

Before [Gatsby version 4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-4), it only provided SSG. For large sites, the build time was very long. Starting from Gatsby version 4, it is now similar to Next.js.

### Pros

- Gatsby provides DSG, SSG, SSR, and CSR on a per-page basis. You can even mix build time data with SSR.
- Has many [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) which can save you time and energy.
- Includes GraphQL by default.
- Can optimize images using [the Gatsby Image Plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image).

### Cons

- A bit harder than Create React App

There're other React frameworks too, but they are not as popular.

## What to use

For beginners, I recommend Create React App. Otherwise, I recommend Next.js.
