**This blog assumes you know React basics.**

React frameworks are the frameworks that are built on top of React.

- Next.js
- Gatsby
- Remix
- Hydrogen
- Refine
- and many more that come out every week.

## Why not just use React?

I won't talk about using React with Babel and Webpack. I'll talk about Create React App. React can only do [client-side rendering](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#csr). You can setup [server-side rendering](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#server-rendering) and other rendering methods, but it's an extra step.

### Pros

- Easiest

### Cons

- No server-side rendering and other rendering methods by default
- No code-splitting by default
- Have to use a route library like React Router which is harder than file-based routing

## Next.js

### Pros

- Next.js can do Static Site Generation, Server-Side Rendering, Incremental Static Regeneration, and Client-Side Rendering.
- Can build full-stack app using [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
- [File-based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) (When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.)
- Can optimize images using the Image Component.

### Cons

- More complex (maybe?)

I recommend Create React App for beginners. If you know React well, I recommend Next.js.
