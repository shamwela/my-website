**Syntax Highlighting**: Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.

## [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)

Headwind is an opinionated Tailwind CSS class sorter. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order. Headwind runs on save, will remove duplicate classes, and can even sort entire workspaces.

## [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss)

Tailwind is built on top of PostCSS. Since VS Code doesn't understand PostCSS out of the box, it will warn about custom CSS at-rules like `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@screen`. Install this extension to get rid of those warnings.

There are also great, general-purpose VS Code extensions. Read about them [here](/blog/favorite-visual-studio-code-extensions).
