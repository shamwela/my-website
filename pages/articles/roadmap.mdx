# Web Development Roadmap for Beginners

_This is just my opinion and it's OK to disagree with me._

This roadmap is for people who want to self-study web development. Teaching yourself how to code is great but 1 major drawback is that you don't have a strict curriculum like a university. So, I created this roadmap to help beginners.

Learn these in this specific order. Don't skip.

## Prerequisites

- A computer
- Internet connection
- A quiet place to study and code

## Basics

1. Learn how to type without looking down at the keyboard
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. JavaScript
5. Git and GitHub

_Do you prefer front-end or back-end? If you can't choose, I recommend starting with the front-end._

## Front-end

1. React
2. Next.js
3. TypeScript
4. Tailwind CSS

## Back-end

1. PostgreSQL
2. MongoDB
3. APIs
4. GraphQL

_Keep learning._
