      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This is my website to share about me, my projects, and blog.</p>
      <p>
        Almost everything is pre-rendered using Static Site Generation. So, this
        is extremely fast.
      </p>

        Main framework: Next.js
        <br />

        Source code is currently private because I don't want others to copy my
        work.
      </p>
      <h2>Purpose and goal</h2>
      <p>
        I built this website because I want to improve my existing tech stack
        knowledge and try out new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        This started out as a blog and later I showcased my projects. My
        expected outcome is to get a developer job.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website design hasn't changed much. I like to keep it simple and
        dark.
      </p>
      <h2>Spotlight</h2>
      <p>
        MDX was the hardest part. MDX is great for content-heavy website like
        mine. There're many ways to implement MDX with Next.js. I chose{' '}
        <code>mdx-bundler</code> because it's simple, feature-rich, and
        recommended by a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I statically import the images and add{' '}
        <code>placeholder='blur'</code>, Next.js will automatically generate a
        blur image placeholder. But I can't statically import images in my MDX
        files. So, I use the following approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I implemented blur image placeholder using <code>plaiceholder</code>.
        Without blur image placeholder, the user will see a blank area while the
        image is loading. This is confusing for the user. With blur image
        placeholder, the user will see a blur image while the image is loading.
        This tells the user that the image is loading. This also gives an
        illusion that the image loads faster.
      </p>
      <h2>Current status</h2>
      <p>
        I usually share my blogs with my friends. They read them to learn about
        web development. They say they like my website ðŸ˜….
