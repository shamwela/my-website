# Git Tutorial

## What is Version Control?

A version control is a software that saves your code again and again. You can restore any previous saved code. Version control has many more features but this is the basics.

## What is Git?

Git is the most popular version control. It's used at almost every company including Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Git provides a history of content changes.

## Git Basics

[Download Git installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and run it.

Create a folder if you haven't already. Open that folder in a command line interface. To initialize Git in a folder, run: `git init`

Create a `index.html` file or any file in your folder. Staging area is an intermediate area where code can be formatted and reviewed before committing. Add `index.html` file to the staging area. `git add index.html`

To add all files, use dot: `git add .`

A commit is a historical version. To commit with a message: `git commit -m 'Your commit message here'`

You can use single or double quotes.

Create a GitHub account and create a repository.

Add a new remote.

`git remote add origin your-link-here`

origin is a common name. You can name it anything you want.

There's only 1 brach for now, main brach. Push your main branch on your computer to origin. origin is your GitHub repository.

`git push -u origin main`

u saves the origin main part. So, next time you push, you can just type git push.

After you've made some code changes, you can type

```
git add .
git commit -m 'Your commit message here'
git push
```

These are just the basics. You can learn more on YouTube.
