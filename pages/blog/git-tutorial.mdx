# Git Tutorial

## What is Version Control?

A version control is a software that saves your code again and again. You can restore any previous saved code.

## What is Git?

Git is the most popular version control. It's used at almost every company including Google, Facebook and Microsoft.

## What is GitHub?

## Benefits of using Git and GitHub

1. You can undo your changes if you made a mistake.
1. They are faster than the alternatives.

## Git and GitHub Basics

[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install them.

Create a new folder on your computer. Create a `index.html` file or any file in that folder. Open Visual Studio Code. In the top left corner, click **File** => **Open Folder** and select the folder you created earlier.

Open **Source Control** view (`Ctrl + Shift + G`). Click **Publish to GitHub**. Click **Allow**. Click **Continue**. Choose **Private** or **Public**. Click **OK**. Click **Open on GitHub** on the bottom right corner and you'll see your repository on GitHub website.

Add some code to your `index.html`.

1. On the left, you will see the message input. Add a message in there, for example: (First commit). Press `Ctrl + Enter` to commit. A commit is a historical version.
1. To push your code from your computer to your GitHub repository, click **Sync Changes**. Open your GitHub repository in your browser. You will see the new changes.

Everytime you changes your code, you should repeat the previous 2 steps: **commmiting** and **syncing changes**.

These are just the basics. You can learn more on YouTube.
