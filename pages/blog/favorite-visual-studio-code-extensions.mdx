## Auto Rename Tag

When you rename one HTML tag, automatically rename the paired HTML tag. This also works with JSX and TSX.

## Code Spell Checker

This helps catch common spelling errors.

## Live Server

This is for vanilla front-end projects. Inside VS Code, open any HTML file and click on _Go Live_ on the bottom status bar.

## Auto import

Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports. Works with Typescript and TSX.

## ESLint

This is only for JavaScript. It statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems.

There are also language or framework specific extensions. Examples: Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, React Native Tools and MDX.

This blog post will be edited if I find other useful extensions.
