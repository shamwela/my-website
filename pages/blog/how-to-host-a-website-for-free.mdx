# How to host a website for free

Before following this, you have to know the basics of Git and HTML. If you don't know them, you can learn them on YouTube. This entire process will take you about 15 minutes.

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)

[Create a Vercel account with the GitHub account](https://vercel.com/signup)

[Create a new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new)

Create a folder on your computer and add some code.

Open your project folder in the terminal and type `git init`

Go back to your GitHub repository. Click on the green **Code** button and copy the link. And, type:

```git
git remote add origin (the link you copied here)
git add .
git commit -m 'First commit'
git push -u origin main
```

Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

Click **New Project**.

Import your repository.

Click **Skip** on **Create a Team**.

Click **Deploy**.

Click **Visit** to visit your website.

You can also edit the domain name by selecting the **Settings** tab and then **Domains**. The free domain name will end in **vercel.app**. If you want a custom domain like **yourproject.com**, you have to buy it.

If you want to make changes. Open your project folder in the terminal and type:

```git
git add .
git commit -m 'Your commit message'
git push
```

This will update your website.

If you want to learn more about Vercel, you can read the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts).
