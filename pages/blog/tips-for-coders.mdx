# Tips for Coders

## General Tips

Follow a strict curriculum. Don't learn things randomly.

Don't memorize things.

Code daily.

Sleep 8 hours every night. If you don't rest well, your brain won't work well.

Spend 50% of your time following tutorials and another 50% building your own projects.

Focus on one thing at a time.

Read documentations.

Don't compare your 1 year progress with someone else's 10 years progress.

Certifications are good to have but projects are more important.

Learn how to use Git and GitHub early. And put your projects on GitHub.

## HTML

id is used when a component is used only once. (example: `payment-section`)

class is used when a component is used more than once. (example: `primary-button`)

## CSS

id is prefixed with `#`. (example: `#payment-section`)

class is prefixed with dot(`.`). (example: `.primary-button`)

Don't use Bootstrap.

After learning CSS basics, learn Tailwind CSS.

## JavaScript

Never use `var` because it will cause so many bugs. Use `const` or `let` instead.

Don't add semicolons to improve readability.

After learning JavaScript, learn React, Next.js and TypeScript in that order.
