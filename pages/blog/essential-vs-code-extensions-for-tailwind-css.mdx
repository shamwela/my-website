# Essential VS Code extensions for Tailwind CSS

Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you haven't already. It's feature-rich, fast, and free.

## [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

**Autocomplete**: Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as CSS functions and directives.

**Syntax Highlighting**: Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.

## [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)

Headwind is an opinionated Tailwind CSS class sorter. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order. Headwind runs on save, will remove duplicate classes, and can even sort entire workspaces.

## [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss)

Tailwind is built on top of PostCSS. Since VS Code doesn't understand PostCSS out of the box, it will warn about custom CSS at-rules like `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@screen`. Install this extension to get rid of those warnings.

There are also great, general-purpose VS Code extensions. Read about them <Link href='/blog/favorite-visual-studio-code-extensions'><a>here</a></Link>.
