# Why I Love Tailwind CSS

## 1. Can do single-file component structure

Since the classes are written in a single file, it's easy to structure your components.

## 2. Can scale well

Tailwind is used at Algolia, Clubhouse, CovertKit and many other companies.

## 3. Editing the CSS only affects the specific component

## 4. No dead CSS

If you delete a markup, the CSS will also be deleted. So, there's no dead CSS.

## 5. You don't have to name elements

Sometimes, naming an element is even harder than writing the CSS. In Tailwind CSS, you just write the classes, so you don't have to name elements.

## 6. Easier and faster to write and read

Instead of typing `display: flex;`, you can just add `flex` class to the element. It's arguably easier and faster to write and read.

## 7. Design is more consistent (No random numbers)

## 8. Easy to debug
