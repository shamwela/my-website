# Why I Love Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

Tailwind syntax looks like this:

<Image src={TailwindCSSCodeExample} alt='Tailwind CSS Code Example' />
<Image src={TailwindCSSOutput} alt='Taiwind CSS Output' />

If you use Tailwind CSS in a vanilla project, you will duplicate the classes a lot and it's not maintainable. Only use Tailwind with a component-based framework or library like React, Vue or Angular.

Tailwind CSS restricts your design a little bit to make it look consistent and pretty but is also customizable enough to build any design.

Coding with Tailwind is a lot faster than CSS-in-JS, vanilla CSS or any other styling methods.

Since the HTML, CSS and JavaScript are in a single file, it's easy to move and edit your code.

It can scale well. Tailwind is used at Algolia, Clubhouse, CovertKit and many other companies.

Editing the CSS only affects the specific component.

No dead CSS. If you delete a markup, the CSS will also be deleted. So, there's no dead CSS.

You don't have to name elements. Sometimes, naming an element is even harder than writing the CSS. In Tailwind CSS, you just write the classes, so you don't have to name elements.

Easier and faster to write and read. Instead of typing `display: flex;`, you can just add `flex` class to the element. It's arguably easier and faster to write and read.

## Some drawbacks

Nothing is perfect. Tailwind CSS syntax is a bit strange at first, but you'll get used to it. Although it is very easy, you still have to learn it.
