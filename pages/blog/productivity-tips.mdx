# Productivity tips

I'm not a productivity expert but these tips might help you. You can use any apps but the followings are my favorites.

- For highest priority or repeated tasks, I use Google Calendar.
- For other tasks, I use Todoist.
- For notes, I use Notion. Favorite the pages that you use most often.

All of these are free.

Do only one thing at a time. Don't multitask. Minimize task switching. For example, I blog on Monday and Tuesday. I code on other days. This way, I use less mental energy and can focus more.

Plan almost every hour of your day. Also put your chill time in there.

I use social media less than 2 hours a day. I turn off almost every notification. I follow only the accounts that either add value or entertain. Unfollow or block everything else.

I delete apps that haven't used within a week. In my opinion, gaming is a waste of time and energy. So, I don't play games.

I sleep about 8 hours every night which is great physically and mentally.

I work 2 hours and rest 1 hours and repeat. That's been working well for me.

I don't do anything that doesn't improve my life like smoking, drinking alcohol.

Delete unnecessary files and organize the remaining ones.

Use cross-platform apps. These are the apps that can run on both mobile and desktop. Install these apps on both your computer and phone to maximize productivity.

Your work hours shouldn't be interrupted. Turn off your phone's notifications (if you can). Use a headphone.
